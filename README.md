## 🚀 Starting

This repository hosts the concluding project from the [HTML5 course](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/curso/html5/) instructed by [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/). This course concludes with the development of my final project – a website devoted to showcasing the cutting-edge technology of [Google Glass](https://www.google.com/glass/start/). Harnessing the power of HTML5 for structuring, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, the project exemplifies the practical application of these languages in developing a dynamic and engaging web platform.

This project served as my initial introduction to HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, playing a fundamental role in broadening my expertise in web development. I gained a comprehensive understanding of these languages, which significantly contributed to my academic pursuits in my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems at [UDESC](https://www.udesc.br/).

## 📚 Features

Used during the evolution of the website:

- Header, navigation menu, article, aside, and footer.
- Images and videos.
- Links to external resources.
- Defining the form's width and margin.
- Applying styling to input and textarea elements, including a sans-serif font, normal weight, and background color.
- Implementing a hover effect with a changed background color for input and textarea elements.
- Styling the legend element with specified color, font weight, font size, and font family.
- Setting the border color and margin for the fieldset element.
- Adding background images to specific fieldset elements.

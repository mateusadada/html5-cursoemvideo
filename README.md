## 🚀 Starting

This repository hosts the concluding project from the [HTML5 course](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/curso/html5/) instructed by [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/). This course concludes with the development of my final project – a website devoted to showcasing the cutting-edge technology of [Google Glass](https://www.google.com/glass/start/). Harnessing the power of HTML5 for structuring, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, the project exemplifies the practical application of these languages in developing a dynamic and engaging web platform.

This project served as my initial introduction to HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, playing a fundamental role in broadening my expertise in web development. I gained a comprehensive understanding of these languages, which significantly contributed to my academic pursuits in my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems at [UDESC](https://www.udesc.br/).

## 📚 Features

Used during the evolution of the website:

- Header, navigation menu, article, aside, and footer.
- Images and videos.
- Links to external resources.
- Defining the form's width and margin.
- Applying styling to input and textarea elements, including a sans-serif font, normal weight, and background color.
- Implementing a hover effect with a changed background color for input and textarea elements.
- Styling the legend element with specified color, font weight, font size, and font family.
- Setting the border color and margin for the fieldset element.
- Adding background images to specific fieldset elements.

## 📋 Prerequisites

No software installation on your computer is required; simply access the site directly through your browser. This approach ensures convenience and immediate access to the system's features and information. The site is compatible with modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, and does not require additional updates or plug-ins for basic functionality.
